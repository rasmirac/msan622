Repository Setup
==============================

This is a template repository, designed to be forked and cloned to setup your own repository for submissions. If you perform this process properly, you will be able to easily receive updates on assignments *and* submit those assignments.

Forking Your Repository
------------------------------

To setup your own repository, you want to start by forking (and then cloning) this repository. See the [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) or [Forking Projects](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/) GitHub guides for detailed steps. 

Using Git For Submission 
------------------------------

If you are unfamiliar with `git`, there are many fantastic and free guides available online (just search for `git`). We will also demonstrate a barebones workflow in-class.

GitHub also has free [Github for Mac](https://help.github.com/categories/31/articles) and [Github for Windows](https://help.github.com/categories/58/articles) applications you can download to manage your `git` repositories. However, just about any `git` client will work as well. For example, [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a more powerful `git` client that is free and has versions for both Mac and Windows.

Updating Your Repository
------------------------------

Assignment details will be updated throughout the semester. You can pull in changes from this repository into your forked repository. See [Fork a Repo: Pull in Upstream Changes](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#pull-in-upstream-changes) or [How Can I Push or Pull?](https://help.github.com/articles/how-can-i-push-or-pull) if you are using the GitHub for Mac or Windows applications. 

Modifying README Files
------------------------------

Basic `README.md` files are provided for you in each directory. These files are automatically displayed by GitHub. The files are in **Markdown**, which is an easy to read and learn markup language. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, check out the [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/88/articles) or [Mastering Markdown](http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/) GitHub guides.

Make sure you replace all text within square brackets `[` `]` with the necessary information. For example, replace `[USERNAME]` with your USF Connect username. 

You will be able to embed images and code directly into your `README.md` file if required by the discussion. For an example, check out the [`homework0/`](homework0/) repository.
