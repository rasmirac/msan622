Project Sketch
==============================

This assignment will help you prepare for the final project. You should have already chosen a dataset to visualize. Next, you will sketch out the tools and packages you will use to prepare your dataset, and the initial set of techniques you will try to implement.

:warning: Try not to spend over an hour on this assignment. The goal is to get you thinking about your final project, and planning a way forward for working on it.

Planned Tools
------------------------------

Include which `R` packages or other tools you plan to use for your final project, how you plan to use them, and why you choose them. Your final project should use at a minimum a combination of `R`, `ggplot2`, and `shiny` to visualize your dataset. 

However, you may also want to use other packages or tools. In particular, we will **not** cover how to implement map or graph-based visualizations in `ggplot2`, as this may not be the best tool for those types of visualizations. You are welcome to learn and use the appropriate tool(s) for those types of visualizations if you want.

Planned Techniques
------------------------------

Include a list of four different techniques you plan to implement, why you choose those techniques for your dataset, and what you hope to learn. You should have approximately 3 to 5 sentences per technique.

Keep in mind you will be asked to implement 1 to 2 prototypes for peer review.

Planned Interaction
------------------------------

Describe the types of interaction you want to include (filtering, brushing, zooming, panning, sorting, and so on). You can discuss this per technique or overall if you plan to integrate all of the techniques into a single `shiny` app.

Keep in mind you will be asked to implement at least one of your planned interactions along with your prototype.

Planned Interface
------------------------------

Draw an annotated sketch illustrating the interface you plan to create for your prototypes and interactions. You can draw this on paper and upload a scan, use the free Google Drive Drawing tool, or use any other tool that allows you to upload the result as a PDF.

This does not have to be anything fancy. Just enough to show you have thought about how you would like to bring everything together.
