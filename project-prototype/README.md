Project Prototype
==============================

For this assignment, you must:

- **Produce one static visualization prototype.** You will receive detailed feedback from your classmates on this prototype, so choose wisely.

- **Develop a `shiny` interface prototype for your desired interaction.** The controls do not need to actually work yet, just focus on which UI elements you want to use.

Ideally, these would be based on your project sketch. 

## Discussion ################

Please include a `README.md` with a brief description of your dataset, an image of your static prototype and description of that prototype, and a screenshot of your interface and a description of that interface.

## Submission ################

Submit your R source code (and any required images) in a `project-prototype` directory within your `msan622` repository on GitHub. Make sure to include a `README.md` file with your name, email, and discussion.

After all of the necessary files are pushed to your repository, submit a link to your `project-prototype` directory on Canvas.

## Exercise ##################

We will have small-group exercises to evaluate your prototypes during class. Please check the announcements for details.
