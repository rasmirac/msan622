Project Dataset
==============================

Your final project in this class is to visualize a dataset of your choosing using a method you have implemented in `R` using `ggplot2`, `GGally`, `shiny`, and any other `R` packages you require.

Choosing a Dataset
------------------------------

You want to select a dataset with at least 4 columns and a diverse set of data types (e.g. numerical, categorical). This will give you more flexibility in the type of visualizations you choose to implement. 

You also want a _reasonable_ number of rows (at least 100, ideally much more). Too few rows will limit how much you can learn from your visualizations. However, the larger the dataset, the less responsive `shiny` will become. You can take a subset of the original dataset if needed in this case.

Also, keep in mind that we will only cover the implementation of basic plots and multivariate, text, and temporal visualization techniques before the end of the half-semester.

_You may change datasets later on in the semester with instructor approval. Otherwise, this should be the dataset you use for your final project._

### Choosing a Public Dataset ###

The first step is to identify a dataset you find interesting. Go to <http://datavis.cs.usfca.edu/resources> for a list of dataset sources. You can also look for datasets tied to visualization contests. One of our students was an honorable mention in the [Urban Data Challenge](http://urbandatachallenge.org/winning-projects-2/) last year!

### Choosing a Private Dataset ###

You can choose a dataset from your practicum as well, but you must be _careful_. At the very least, your sponsor must be comfortable with this dataset being viewed by the instructor and your classmates. Ideally, your sponsor should be comfortable with you releasing the dataset publicly, so that you can show off your final visualization to a wider audience.

You must give me a **compelling** reason to select a private dataset that you cannot share publicly.

Dataset Information
------------------------------

The graded survey on Canvas will ask you for the following information:

- Location of the dataset (ideally a URL)
- Whether this dataset can be shared publicly
- Type of data in the dataset (e.g. numerical, categorical, unstructured, and so on)
- Why you chose this dataset (3 to 5 sentences)

Please make sure you submit this information on-time to avoid a grade penalty.

Dataset Preparation _(Optional)_
------------------------------

If you have chosen a public dataset, please include it in your `msan/project-dataset` repository. (If it is too big, you'll run into problems.) 

You can also perform some initial cleaning of your dataset, including removing rows with invalid or missing data, or removing columns that you are not interested in visualizing. Please indicate your modifications to the dataset in a `README.md` file in that repository.

If you want me to take a look, add a comment to your dataset submission in Canvas.
